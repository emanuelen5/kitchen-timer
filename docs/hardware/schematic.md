# Schematic
## Crystal Oscilator
* We are using a [TODO] crystal oscilator.
* ATmega328p datasheet recommend caps of 2-22pF to go with it.

## Reset Button
* We are not adding a pull-up resistor because the RESET pin on the ATmega328p alrady has one.

## Bootloader auto-reset
* We will use the DTR line of the UART module to trigger a quick reset of the MCU. [[1]](#1)

## Bootloader upload pins
* This is a set of pins to connect a programmer.

## Power LED
* We added an LED to indicate that the device is powered.

## UART Module
* We are using the BTE17-06B module
* This module has an overcurrent protection fusion that allows only 500mA.

## BMS Module
* Resistor R3 on the module is the charging current programming resistor. This resistor needs to be changed to an appropiate value for the battery used [TODO] (What value?) 

## Power Path
* See reference circuit in [[3]](#3)

## 3.3V Linear Regulator
* We are using the AP2111 [[2]](#2)
* The schematic has been taken from the datasheet (see "Typical Application", page 19)

## 5V Boost Converter
* We are using the TPS61200, Low Input Voltage Synchronous Boost Converter. [[4]](#4)
* The schematic has been taken from the [Sparkfun module](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Prototyping/Li_Power_Boost_Converter.pdf)

## LED Matrices Display
* We are using 4 common-cathode LED matrices.

## Piezo Speaker


* For the future, there are different circuits that could be implemented [[5]](#5)

## EMD protection
[TODO](Do we need this? We will have a USB connection. maybe we do.)
