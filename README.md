# Kitchen timer

We're building a Kitchen timer!
The project is heavily inspired by [REST: Kitchen timer by mkdxdx [Hackaday.io]](https://hackaday.io/project/194386-rest-kitchen-timer).

## Hardware

* Atmega328P as microcontroller
* Rotary encoder for setting the time
* 16x16 LED matrix as display
* 32 kHz crystal for accurate time keeping
* (Passive?) buzzer for beeping

### Schematic
